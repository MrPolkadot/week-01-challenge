# Week 1 Challenge: Code Refactor 

## Description

In this challenge of week 1, the assignment is to refactor the starter code given to us. The objective was to modify the code in order to make it more accessible and clean. I used semantic **HTML** tags and cleaned up the **CSS** code as well, by learning from the ***DRY*** rule.
